Learning Large Language Models (LLMs)

This repository contains code to help you understand key steps involved in the development of Large Language Models (LLMs). The learning process is divided into three main stages:

Preprocessing & Tokenization

Pretraining & Embedding Creation

Tuning Parameters & Attention Mechanism

Overview

This repository provides code implementations for the fundamental steps of LLM training:

1. Tokenization

Tokenization is the process of breaking text into smaller units, such as words or subwords, that a model can understand.

Implements Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) and WordPiece tokenization.

Converts text into numerical representations.

2. Embedding Creation

Embeddings are dense vector representations of tokens that capture semantic meaning.

Uses techniques like Word2Vec, GloVe, or Transformer-based embeddings.

Helps map words to multi-dimensional spaces.

3. Attention Mechanism

The attention mechanism allows a model to focus on relevant parts of the input sequence.

Implements self-attention and multi-head attention.

Enhances the modelâ€™s ability to capture dependencies in text.
